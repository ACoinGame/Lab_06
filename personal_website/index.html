    <h2>(Feb. 17) Midterm: RIP</h2>
    <p>
      Today is the last day of midterm week. I thought I am prepared
      enough for this HTML midterm, but apparently I am not. I do
      <emp>really</emp> bad on the midterm. I would not be surprised if I
      don't pass. I'm going to be depressed for the long weekend. BibleThump

    <h2>(Feb. 19) HTML Midterm: Passed!</h2>
    <p>
      I pass the HTML midterm. I get a higher grade than I expected.
      NickuYou is a lenient marker. We also get additional partial marks
      from some multiple choice questions because Neda is nice. Still, I
      need to give up co-op at this point. I was hoping I can do well on
      all 6 courses to make up comm 1116. It's <emp>impossible</emp> for
      me to do well in comm.
