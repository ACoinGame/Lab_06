                Information technology professionals spend time each day
                communicating orally and in writing with their supervisors,
                colleagues and clients. As problem-solvers and entrepreneurs in
                industry, you need to communicate quickly, clearly, and
                effectively. This course will teach you how to be a professional
                and efficient communicator at work. You will write effective
                business correspondence and instructions and deliver a formal
                oral presentation to your set. The first term establishes the
                principles and basic patterns on which you will build more
                advanced applications in the second term.

                The course introduces the fundamental concepts of programming
                for IT professionals, with a focus on scripting languages that
                are commonly found in the workplace. Projects, assignments, and
                activities are representative of tasks that IT professionals are
                likely to encounter in the workplace. Students taking this
                course will design, implement, test, and debug programs that
                incorporate: variables, expressions, assignments, I/O,
                conditional and iterative control constructs, functions, and
                parameter passing. The course assumes no previous programming
                experience
